# Microservices Example

Simple example of how to create microservices with the [Moleculer framework](https://moleculer.services).

This is the code from the [Microservices Crash Course](https://youtu.be/fEDT4lWWe9g) on YouTube. There are 3 very simple services (user, email, auth) with actions to mock/simulate creating a user, getting users, sending an email and authenticating a user.

## Usage

Run the services:

```bash
npm start
```
